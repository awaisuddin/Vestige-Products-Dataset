<td>DescriptionVestige Detox Foot Patches You can remove your body toxin¬†by using a¬†detox foot patch.¬†Do you know when you sleep your body uses this time to repair itself from the damage done by your body from everyday life?It‚Äôs a Very Simple Method that you can even do while you are sleeping. It doesn‚Äôt require any exercise the eating of certain foods or anything else.¬† Just simply put your Vestige detox foot patch into the bottom of your feet and go to sleep.¬† The patch will work throughout the night and will remove toxins from your body. This method of detoxification is based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) according to this there are various pressure points within your feet and hands that directly link to organs within your body.Vestige Detox Foot Patches helps you regain health and vitality by helping the body eliminate toxins through a natural process. It works on the principle of reflexology which is based on the concept that areas on the foot correspond to different areas of the body and that manipulating these may improve health. These patches are 100 % natural safe easy to use and provide rapid detoxification.Advisory: ¬†Drink plenty of water to assist complete detoxification.How you will understand that our body needs detoxification?Are you feeling¬†fatigued stressed?Do you have¬†excess body weight?You often have skin breakouts and blemishes and/or a tired dull and lack-lustre complexion.Are you feeling regular¬†colds¬†flu¬†viral infection¬†easily and are often on medication?Is your digestion being troublesome uncomfortable and irregular?Are you taking regular fast food or unhealthy food?Are you consuming¬†coffee alcohol drugs (prescription or otherwise) or cigarettes?You are exposed to common environmental toxins such as carbon emissions cigarette smoke herbicides pesticides artificial fragrances and household chemicals.Are you feeling¬†frequent headaches¬†or¬†lack of mental clarity?You often feel emotionally unstable depressed unmotivated and lacking energy and enthusiasm for life.Foot Reflexology encourages the body to work naturally to restore its own healthy balance. A toxic body simply cannot maintain the normal cleansing performance required to maintain optimal health. Over time if these toxins are not removed they may lead to various debilitating and chronic health conditions.However once the various body components that may have been adversely affected by the toxins are cleansed the body makes its natural adjustments to return to its original state of health. Also as the body releases these toxins the negative health symptoms that may have been caused by the toxic overload usually start to recede and may even disappear altogether.Detoxification is the process of removal of toxins or other harmful substances from the body. Our body constantly keeps working towards eliminating metabolic waste and toxins with the help of the liver kidneys lungs skin and intestines. The circulatory digestive and lymphatic systems assist the body in this task. But with the change in living conditions and habits over the years the number of external toxins that enter our body has increased considerably consumption of junk food pharmaceutical drugs food additives use of cosmetics and exposure to environmental and all pollutants increases the workload on the body‚Äôs detox and leads to accumulation of harmful toxins in the body sluggish metabolism chronic constipation bloating irritability fatigue bad breath body pains insomnia uneven skin and premature ageing are some of the signs of toxin buildup in the body.DETOX TIPS (daily)Drink lemon water in the morning on an empty stomach.Drink fruit infused water throughout the day.Drink herbal teas throughout the day.Eat whole foods rich in fibre antioxidants and healthy fats.VESTIGE DETOX FOOT PATCHESWhat is Vestige Detox Foot Patch?A Vestige Detox Foot Patch is designed in order to absorb toxins from the body while sleeping.

<td>DescriptionVestige Detox Foot Patches You can remove your body toxin¬†by using a¬†detox foot patch.¬†Do you know when you sleep your body uses this time to repair itself from the damage done by your body from everyday life?It‚Äôs a Very Simple Method that you can even do while you are sleeping. It doesn‚Äôt require any exercise the eating of certain foods or anything else.¬† Just simply put your Vestige detox foot patch into the bottom of your feet and go to sleep.¬† The patch will work throughout the night and will remove toxins from your body. This method of detoxification is based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) according to this there are various pressure points within your feet and hands that directly link to organs within your body.Vestige Detox Foot Patches helps you regain health and vitality by helping the body eliminate toxins through a natural process. It works on the principle of reflexology which is based on the concept that areas on the foot correspond to different areas of the body and that manipulating these may improve health. These patches are 100 % natural safe easy to use and provide rapid detoxification.Advisory: ¬†Drink plenty of water to assist complete detoxification.How you will understand that our body needs detoxification?Are you feeling¬†fatigued stressed?Do you have¬†excess body weight?You often have skin breakouts and blemishes and/or a tired dull and lack-lustre complexion.Are you feeling regular¬†colds¬†flu¬†viral infection¬†easily and are often on medication?Is your digestion being troublesome uncomfortable and irregular?Are you taking regular fast food or unhealthy food?Are you consuming¬†coffee alcohol drugs (prescription or otherwise) or cigarettes?You are exposed to common environmental toxins such as carbon emissions cigarette smoke herbicides pesticides artificial fragrances and household chemicals.Are you feeling¬†frequent headaches¬†or¬†lack of mental clarity?You often feel emotionally unstable depressed unmotivated and lacking energy and enthusiasm for life.Foot Reflexology encourages the body to work naturally to restore its own healthy balance. A toxic body simply cannot maintain the normal cleansing performance required to maintain optimal health. Over time if these toxins are not removed they may lead to various debilitating and chronic health conditions.However once the various body components that may have been adversely affected by the toxins are cleansed the body makes its natural adjustments to return to its original state of health. Also as the body releases these toxins the negative health symptoms that may have been caused by the toxic overload usually start to recede and may even disappear altogether.Detoxification is the process of removal of toxins or other harmful substances from the body. Our body constantly keeps working towards eliminating metabolic waste and toxins with the help of the liver kidneys lungs skin and intestines. The circulatory digestive and lymphatic systems assist the body in this task.

Of the more than 30000 species of algae blue-green algae such as Spirulina are the most primitive.¬†Spirulina is a ‚ÄúSuperfood.‚Äù It is the most nutritious concentrated whole food for us. It has a very rich history. Spirulina is an amazing food. Spirulina is good for all ages of people. Spirulina‚Äôs concentrated nutrition makes it an ideal food supplement for people of all ages and lifestyles. Spirulina contains every essential amino acid and about 60% complete highly digestible protein.¬† Spirulina supplies nutrients that are lacking in most of our diets. Spirulina is about sixty percent protein ‚Äì far more than any other food. Its protein is complete meaning that it contains all the essential amino acids. While most animal proteins are high in fat calories and cholesterol Spirulina is only five percent fat.Three grams of Spirulina has¬†more antioxidant and anti-inflammatory¬†activity than five servings of fruits and vegetables.Spirulina¬†10 times more iron than spinach.Spirulina has¬†5 times more beta carotene than carrots.Spirulina has¬†5 times more protein than tofu.Comparing phytonutrient levels Spirulina is¬†31 times more potent than blueberries 60 times more potent than spinach and 700 times¬†more potent than apples.Spirulina‚Äôs¬†protein is easily digestible and assimilated.Spirulina is¬†rich carotenoids like zeaxanthin and beta-cryptoxanthin¬†as well as lesser-known carotenoids such as myxoxanthophyll and echinenone.Spirulina is an excellent¬†source of Vitamin B12. Vitamin B-12¬†is essential for normal growth and neurological functionVitamin B 12 deficiency causes fatigue and moodiness and eventually neurological damage.The body does produce its own B-12 and can store it for years but vegetarians in particular are susceptible to B-12 deficiency.The richest sources of B-12 are meats ‚Äì especially organ meats ‚Äì and dairy foods.Spirulina is¬†helpful in weight management. Spirulina is¬†extremely nutritious¬†‚Äì high in complete protein beta-carotene B vitamins minerals gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) enzymes and micronutrients. Taking Spirulina before meals¬†helps to satisfy the appetite¬†so that one eats less at mealtimes and doesn‚Äôt feel as hungry between meals. There are less than four calories in a gram of Spirulina. Using Spirulina to help satisfy your appetite is a healthy and safe way to lose weight.Iron deficiency is very common in women who eat less food than men on average and lose iron during menstruation. Vegetarian women are especially prone to iron deficiency.

Use a tongue scraper or a toothbrush that has a built-in tongue cleaner.FluorideFluoride is a mineral that occurs naturally in all water sources.Research has shown that fluoride helps to¬†reduce cavities and helps repair the early stages of tooth decay.How does it work for the teeth?Food particles left behind in the mouth break down into sugars that are broken down into cavity-causing acids by bacteria.Acids dissolve minerals from the tooth enamel a process called demineralization.This makes teeth weaker and results in tooth decay.That‚Äôs where fluoride comes in. When fluoride reaches the teeth it gets absorbed into the enamel.It helps to repair the enamel by replenishing the lost calcium and phosphorous strengthening the teeth ‚Äì a process called re-mineralization.When fluoride is present during re-mineralization the minerals deposited into the tooth enamel help strengthen teeth.This way fluoride helps stop the decay process.Always use fluoride-containing toothpaste at least¬†twice daily to keep cavities at bay.It is effective and safe to use even for children.‡§°‡•á‡§Ç‡§ü‡§æ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§∞ ‡§ü‡•Ç‡§•‡§™‡•á‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü ‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä / Dentassure Toothpaste Hindi¬†‡§°‡•á‡§Ç‡§ü‡§æ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§∞ ‡§ü‡•Ç‡§•‡§™‡•á‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü ‡§è‡§ï ‡§Ö‡§®‡•ã‡§ñ‡§æ ‡§´‡•â‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§≤‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§á‡§∏‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§®‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§≤‡•å‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§¶‡•Å‡§ó‡§®‡•Ä ‡§∏‡•Å‡§∞‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§ú‡•ã ‡§ï‡•Ä‡§ü‡§æ‡§£‡•Å‡§ì‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•á ‡§≤‡•ú‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§¶‡§æ‡§Ç‡§§‡•ã ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•à‡§µ‡§ø‡§ü‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§®‡§®‡•á ‡§∏‡•á ‡§∞‡•ã‡§ï‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à. ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§Æ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§°‡§º‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§• ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§¶‡§æ‡§Ç‡§§‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§ú‡§¨‡•Ç‡§§ ‡§¨‡§®‡§æ‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à. ‡§á‡§∏‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•à‡§≤‡•ç‡§∂‡§ø‡§Ø‡§Æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§ú‡•ã ‡§¶‡§æ‡§Ç‡§§‡•ã ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§ú‡§¨‡•Ç‡§§ ‡§¨‡§®‡§æ‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à. ‡§á‡§∏‡•á ‡§§‡§æ‡•õ‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§æ‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§ö‡§Æ‡§ï‡§§‡•á ‡§¶‡§æ‡§Ç‡§§‡•ã ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§∞‡•ã‡•õ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§á‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á‡§Æ‡§æ‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç.Dentassure Toothpaste 100 gm Price:¬†Dentassure Toothpaste¬†Price / MRP / DP / BV / PV¬†in India:¬†¬†Vestige¬†Dentassure Toothpaste¬†quality¬†is very good.¬†Compare to other National &amp; International Brands &amp; its¬†benefits¬†Dentassure Toothpaste¬†price¬†very less &amp;¬†reasonable.¬† Dentassure Toothpaste¬†MRP¬†is¬†75¬†and¬†DP is 65 inclusive of all taxes.¬†Its PV is¬†2.17¬†To get products in distributor price¬†Join vestige.Dentassure Toothpaste¬†Quantity:¬†Dentassure Toothpaste¬†is available in¬†100 gm packing.Dentassure Toothpaste¬†Reviews /¬†Dentassure Toothpaste¬†ResultsDentassure Toothpaste is a unique formula and comes with the dual protection of Neem and Clove that fights germs and prevents dental cavities.

Filter ‚Äì Cleans dirt soil. Big P.P. filter helps to clean more.2) Carbon Filter ‚Äì Made of small particles of carbon which helps to clean muscular dirt. 3) RO Membrane ‚Äì Sharp Water Purifier has US RO Membrane which has a life span of 2 years and also cleans toxic substances such as 93.3 arsenic.4) AFD Disruptor ‚Äì This technique is not yet available in any other water purifier and it makes water 99.9% clean. Other water purifiers give a lot of emphasis on the UV to clean up biological mess. But with the UV technology organic matter such as germs and bacteria either become inactive for some time or die.

The body requires to be fed with a suitable amount of water to avoid dehydration. The precise amount depends on the activities ambient temperature and humidity. Water is not the only source to manage the body‚Äôs fluid content. Fruits food and some beverages also provide fluids to our body that help in hydration. The critical point is humans require drinking water with fewer impurities which can then be absorbed in the systemic circulation. The journey of Water (mouth tongue to esophagus towards the stomach and finally excretion) ‚Äì this is where the importance of maintaining normal pH is explained. For example Acid is vital to help in eliminating the bacteria or other pathogens in the stomach. The acidic environment helps in the digestion of food. The enzyme Pepsin which helps to breakdown proteins in the stomach can only function optimally in the low pH environment.Preliminary Introduction on Sharp Water Purifier WJ-400This Water Purifier is designed for complete installation flexibility keeping urban households in mind. The three major components are the Main Unit Water Storage Tank and Water Tap. The Main Unit can be installed at the Wall Under Sink or even kept on the kitchen work area. The Water Storage Tank is recommended to be placed under the sink only while the Water tap may be connected on the basin or even hanged on the wall. This kind of flexibility ensures total utilization of space in your kitchen area. The unique Filtration system and quality of filters make sure that we get consistent and superior quality of drinking water for the entire life of the filters. The life of filters and quality of Water may vary depending on input water conditions.Additional Special Note: Our Water Purifier provides the purest water to ensure that it is BIOAVAILABLE while maintaining the pH similar to the input. What is TDS?TDS or Total Dissolved Solids is measured in mg/Liter of Water which is the most soluble substance in our universe a variety of metals or other impurities get easily dissolved.Types of salts and minerals that constitute the TDSThe useful ones are Magnesium Sodium Potassium Phosphorous and CalciumThe harmful ones are high-level bicarbonates of calcium iron and sodium. Other soluble impurities include nitrate arsenic chlorides sulfates. It also contains suspended impurities like mud sand or other organic matter. Which devices can measure TDS? How much do they cost? Are they reliable and accurate?TDS measuring devices are readily available on various online e-commerce portals. The good ones cost between Rs 200 to 250. These readings may not be entirely accurate as the right way to measure TDS in a laboratory is to evaporate the water leaving behind the dissolved solutes as residue and then weighing it. However these TDS Meters give a fair idea and thus making sure you can drink the right quality of water while using the right technology. How can we determine the constituents of the TDS in our water supply?With the portable devices available we can measure the weight of soluble impurities in the Water. However unfortunately it can measure both helpful and harmful ones and it can also not be known at what ratio they are. So lower the TDS better is the Water for drinking. Up to what TDS of Water is suitable for drinking?As per WHO Water where TDS is up to 300mg/L is drinkable. However as per Indian Standard No IS 3025 (part 16)- 1984-RA:2012 water with TDS up to 500mg/L is drinkable. What can be done to replenish the useful minerals which are filtered out?Water is not the only source of fluids required by the body nor it‚Äôs the only source of minerals. Most fruits vegetables Grains Supplements can also help replenish the lost minerals. What are the sources of drinking water? Which are the common impurities found in source water?There are primarily two sources of drinking water ‚Äì underground bore-well or municipal supply. In the case of Municipal supply the TDS is generally within 300 to 500 but there is high usage of Chlorine. Moreover when this Water travels through Corporation pipeline it adds enormous amounts of unwanted and carcinogenic substances which may not increase the TDS levels drastically but deteriorates the quality of Water. On the other hand underground bore-well water contains high amounts of turbidity and chemical impurities making it unsuitable for drinking. Thus depending on the condition of source water Purification System may be recommended. Is Water with TDS of lesser than 50mg/L suitable for drinking?TDS measured by these instruments consider helpful minerals (calcium potassium or magnesium) as well as carcinogenic substances and heavy metals (lead mercury arsenic or fluoride). Considering the current condition of source water the ratio may vary depending on location season etc. There are no instruments which can separately measure helpful minerals and unwanted impurities. Hence lower the TDS lesser are the chances of contaminants in drinking water. TDS of less than 50mg/L will not have sufficient minerals is it suitable for drinking?TDS measures both helpful minerals and unwanted impurities in Water. There are no instruments which can separately measure them. Hence we will never come to know the actual ratio between useful minerals and unwanted contaminants. Considering the quality of source water it is evident that higher TDS will have a probability of more impurities. We drink about 3 to 4 liters of water a day; Water is NOT the only source of minerals required by our body.It is advised and wise to eliminate both minerals and impurities from drinking water thus removing the threats of waterborne diseases like Typhoid &amp; Diarrhea completely. While knowing the fact that fruits and vegetables available today contain pesticides still they provide a sufficient amount of such helpful minerals required by the body. Even if they are not fulfilled one can take necessary supplements thus not allowing unwanted substances to enter our body through drinking water by any means. Is it OK to drink Water with TDS less than 50mg/L?Why not? Lesser the TDS purer is the Water. Purer Water has a higher ability to be absorbed in our systemic circulation thus enabling our body to fulfill benefits from drinking water. Up to what TDS of Water is the Vestige Sharp Water Purifier suitable for?We have tested our product model number WJ-400 for TDS of 1547mg/L at TUV Lab (Certificate available on demand). What is suggested in case of a higher TDS?In case of higher TDS and turbidity we recommend additional Pre Filter which can protect the PP (Polypropylene) Filter and RO Membrane from premature failures as none of the Filters are covered under Warranty. The Pre Filter comes in a casing and is connected before the inlet pipe of Water Purifier. Apart from protecting the PP Filter it will also help enhance the performance and life of other Filters (especially RO &amp; CB). The initial cost of Pre Filter is between Rs 700 to 800 (with casing) and the replacement cost is Rs 200. The frequency of replacement is 3 to 6 months depending on the turbidity and the constituents of the source water. PP (Polypropylene) Filter has choked/ blocked before it‚Äôs recommended life! What is the reason? What can be done to prevent this?This is primarily due to the high presence of impurities and turbidity in the source water. Our water purifier ensures that we consistently drink purer quality of Water and hence the pollutants are accumulated in the first set of Filter and never allowed to pass towards the RO Membrane thus ensuring that we get the purest Water for the entire life of all the filters. In case the turbidity is high in your area we recommend the use of Additional Pre Filter. Please refer to the answer to ‚ÄúWhat is suggested in case of higher TDS?‚Äù for more details. How is our PP filter better than Sediment Filter?Sediment Filter uses a sponge-like material. With the pressure of Water and attack from physical impurities like metals or sand the gaps may get enlarged thus leaking the bigger size of particles (more than 5 microns) towards the RO membrane. Eventually the pore size of the RO membrane also gets affected with the continuous blow thus passing on impurities to the drinking water tap. There is no system to block or stop contaminations in Sediment Filters. Since we are drinking this Water regularly we don‚Äôt make out the difference or deterioration in quality. PP or Polypropylene Filter used by Sharp is of a superior quality material that never passes the impurities over 5 microns towards the RO Membrane thus ensuring consistency in output water all through the life of Filters. What is the capacity of our RO Membrane?It is of 50GPD. It means that it can produce up to 8 to 9 liters of water per hour. How is the SHARP Water Purifier RO Membrane better? What is the rated life?Sharp Water Purifier WJ-400 uses RO Membrane from DOW USA which is known to be one of the most premium quality membranes and has an extended life with superior efficiency. The rated life is two years. However it may vary depending on the condition of the source water. What is AF Disruptor Technology? Is it better than UV or UF Technology?AF Disruptor Technology from AHLSTROM used in Sharp Water Purifier employs an ALUMINA FIBRE layer (not made of aluminum). When the water passes through the particular layer it generates a 51mv ZETA Potential that enables the impurities in the water to be separated from running Water. It does not work on the principal of pore size but deflective or disruptive method where the water pressure is retained. AF Disruptor Technology does not require any electricity to operate. UF or Ultra Filtration is based on pore size and is claimed to be effective in reducing particles of up to 0.1 microns with an average efficiency of ~75%. Hence a large number of biological and chemical impurities pass untreated. For the same a UV a light source is deployed in a special casing to generate Ozone when it comes in contact with Water. Ozone can eliminate some pathogens from Water. However in this case stay-time/time the Water remains in connection with the UV is essential and if the water passes through the chamber faster the half- dead pathogens or the dead ones (endotoxins) remain in Water which may cause harm. Moreover since Service Technicians never clean the UV Chamber it thus reduces the effectiveness over time. What is the life of AF Disruptor and how shall we know when to replace?The rated life of AF Disruptor Filter is 12 months. However it may be used for a more extended period if the taste of Water is unchanged and replaced earlier if there is any change in the flavor over time. Since the taste of Water is relative and if you don‚Äôt want to take a chance please replace once in every 12 months. What is the capacity of the Storage Water Tank and how much time does it take to fill it?The Storage Tank capacity of Water Purifier WJ-400 is up to 5.3 liters. It takes approximately 35 to 40 minutes to fill the tank. How much water is produced in one hour?If the Water Purifier is running continuously it can produce up to 8 to 9 liters of water per hour. However it may vary depending on running usage and storage. What is the Warranty period of Water Purifier and what all is covered under Warranty?Our products come with one year warranty from the date of Installation. All electrical and mechanical parts are covered under Warranty except plastic parts and Filters. How do we avail Installation or Warranty Service?In case of Installation Breakdown or any Preventive Service request please use any of the below options:Dial Toll-Free Number 18004254322 between 7 AM and 9 PM on all daysGive a Missed Call at 8750922277 and you will receive a callbackSend email to [email¬†protected]Please use a Mobile Number which response to our representative who will call within 2 to 3 hours. In case it remains unanswered in three attempts our Service Team will cancel the call and send you a message. You will then have to call again to register the request. Never call the Technician for logging complaints unless the call is recorded the service request shall not be entertained. What if my complaint is not attended within 48 hours? What is the escalation process?Except for remote locations all calls are expected to be attended within 24 to 48 hours in case of delay or to report any other serious complaints; please email to [email¬†protected] What is most unique about the Sharp Vestige Water Purifier? What are the key benefits?In the case of most Water Purifiers available in the market output water is stored in Tank after it passes through all the purification stages. While it is evident that most Water Purifiers claim an efficiency of 95 to 99% the remaining impurities accumulate in the Storage Tank. In the absence of regular cleaning it results in the formation of algae and other biological contaminants. So the output drinking water doesn‚Äôt match with the claims made by some of the very reputed brands. In the case of Sharp the Water is passed through AF Disruptor medium before it is delivered through the tap thus ensuring purest drinking water is served at all the times. This can be verified through TUV Test Report Number GGN/F(C/M)/19/003790 which confirms the absolute purity of the output water purifier. Please refer to the chart above.The other benefits include:Flexible Usage and Installation environments: May be installed in Kitchen or any different location with water input conveniences. Suitable for Under the Sink Wall Mount or above the counter.Sharp Original Design and superior build quality: Built with high-grade raw materials wherever purified Water makes contact.Electrical safety &amp; Performance efficiency certificates: TUV RoHS FDA NSDS &amp; SGS verification ensures security and health. What is the meaning of the ‚ÄúFilter Change‚Äù Indicator and how to know the replacement period?The Water Purifier Digital Panel displays the indicator for all Filter sets starting with PP CB RO &amp; AF. The Indicator or charge level whichever you may call it depends on the hour of usage and not according to the water quality. Till such time the PP filter does not block the water it may be used. In case the level indicator comes to ‚ÄòNIL‚Äô and the PP Filter is not blocked you may RESET it and continue using it. However even if the level has not reached ‚ÄòNIL‚Äô and the PP filter is Blocked please replace it. Also read point number 8 &amp; 9 for more details. RESET function is not recommended for CB RO &amp; AF Disruptor; however if the taste and quality are satisfactory you may RESET and reuse only the AF Disruptor. RO Membrane Technology produces drain or wastewater can it be reused?Our RO produces about 65 to 70% of Water which contains impurities (removed from the input water). We request all our valued users to be conscious about the natural resources and the environment thus storing the drained Water in a bucket/ container and use it for mopping floors watering plants and washing utensils. What are the points to keep in mind before Installation?Our Water Purifier WJ-400 is in three parts ‚Äì Main Unit Storage Water Tank and Water Tap. The Main Unit can be mounted on the wall placed on the kitchen top or installed under the sink. You need a 2‚Ä≤ x 2‚Ä≤ space to place the Main Unit. The dimensions are also mentioned in the water purifier outer packing. Please decide on the location once you purchase the Water Purifier. The Storage Tank is recommended to be placed under the sink and the water tap may be fixed either on the sink or wall. In case someone wants to fix the Water Tap in the Kitchen Granite a 25mm hole is to be prepared through an external vendor. Do we need to pay any Installation Charges?Sharp Service Team will do not charge for the installation of the Sharp Vestige Water Purifier WJ-400. Extra charges are only applicable if you purchase additional Pre-Filter based on Technician recommendations (please read point number 11 for more details) No extra charges payable for plumbing and drillings.
