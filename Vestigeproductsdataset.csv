Of the more than 30000 species of algae blue-green algae such as Spirulina are the most primitive.¬†Spirulina is a ‚ÄúSuperfood.‚Äù It is the most nutritious concentrated whole food for us. It has a very rich history. Spirulina is an amazing food. Spirulina is good for all ages of people. Spirulina‚Äôs concentrated nutrition makes it an ideal food supplement for people of all ages and lifestyles. Spirulina contains every essential amino acid and about 60% complete highly digestible protein.¬† Spirulina supplies nutrients that are lacking in most of our diets. Spirulina is about sixty percent protein ‚Äì far more than any other food. Its protein is complete meaning that it contains all the essential amino acids. While most animal proteins are high in fat calories and cholesterol Spirulina is only five percent fat.Three grams of Spirulina has¬†more antioxidant and anti-inflammatory¬†activity than five servings of fruits and vegetables.Spirulina¬†10 times more iron than spinach.Spirulina has¬†5 times more beta carotene than carrots.Spirulina has¬†5 times more protein than tofu.Comparing phytonutrient levels Spirulina is¬†31 times more potent than blueberries 60 times more potent than spinach and 700 times¬†more potent than apples.Spirulina‚Äôs¬†protein is easily digestible and assimilated.Spirulina is¬†rich carotenoids like zeaxanthin and beta-cryptoxanthin¬†as well as lesser-known carotenoids such as myxoxanthophyll and echinenone.Spirulina is an excellent¬†source of Vitamin B12. Vitamin B-12¬†is essential for normal growth and neurological functionVitamin B 12 deficiency causes fatigue and moodiness and eventually neurological damage.The body does produce its own B-12 and can store it for years but vegetarians in particular are susceptible to B-12 deficiency.The richest sources of B-12 are meats ‚Äì especially organ meats ‚Äì and dairy foods.Spirulina is¬†helpful in weight management. Spirulina is¬†extremely nutritious¬†‚Äì high in complete protein beta-carotene B vitamins minerals gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) enzymes and micronutrients. Taking Spirulina before meals¬†helps to satisfy the appetite¬†so that one eats less at mealtimes and doesn‚Äôt feel as hungry between meals. There are less than four calories in a gram of Spirulina. Using Spirulina to help satisfy your appetite is a healthy and safe way to lose weight.Iron deficiency is very common in women who eat less food than men on average and lose iron during menstruation. Vegetarian women are especially prone to iron deficiency. Spirulina is a¬†good source of Iron and easily digestible.Spirulina contains vitamin E selenium and tyrosine which are all known for their powerful anti-aging effects. The antioxidants present in tyrosine eliminate free radicals and slow down the aging process of skin cells.
